## **Overview**
The End-to-End Book Recommendation System integrates a React frontend with various AWS services to process user preferences and generate book recommendations. This document details the setup and configuration of AWS components involved in this architecture.

## **Architecture**

## **Process Flow**
1. **User Input**: Captured via the React frontend.
2. **Request Handling**: Processed by AWS Lambda, which interacts with other AWS services.
3. **Keyword Generation**: Performed by AWS Bedrock with Mistral AI.
4. **Book Data Retrieval**: From Amazon S3, filtered based on generated keywords.
5. **Response Delivery**: Recommendations are sent back to the frontend.

## **AWS Setup**

### **Frontend Deployment**
The React application is hosted on Amazon S3, which serves the frontend assets and ensures scalability.

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Go to the Amazon S3 console.
   - Create a new S3 bucket.
   - Set up bucket policies to allow public access for static website hosting.

2. **Deploy React Application**:
   - Build the React application using `npm run build`.
   - Upload the build folder to the S3 bucket.

3. **Enable Static Website Hosting**:
   - In the S3 bucket properties, enable static website hosting.
   - Specify the index document (e.g., `index.html`).

4. **Configure CDN (Optional)**:
   - Set up Amazon CloudFront for content delivery and caching.

### **Backend Configuration**

#### **API Gateway Setup**
API Gateway serves as the interface between the frontend and backend.

1. **Create an API**:
   - Go to the API Gateway console.
   - Create a new REST API.

2. **Set Up Resources and Methods**:
   - Define resources and HTTP methods (e.g., POST) for the API.
   - Integrate the API methods with AWS Lambda functions.

3. **Configure CORS**:
   - Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests from the frontend.

4. **Deploy the API**:
   - Create a deployment stage and deploy the API.

### **AWS Lambda Configuration**
AWS Lambda executes the backend logic for processing and generating recommendations.

1. **Create a Lambda Function**:
   - Go to the AWS Lambda console.
   - Create a new Lambda function.
   - Choose Python as the runtime.

2. **Configure Lambda Layers**:
   - Add the `boto3` library as a Lambda layer to interact with other AWS services.

3. **Upload Lambda Code**:
   - Upload or paste the code into the Lambda function editor.
   - Set up environment variables and permissions as needed.

4. **Set Lambda Triggers**:
   - Link the Lambda function with API Gateway as a trigger.

### **CloudWatch Monitoring**
AWS CloudWatch monitors Lambda performance and logs.

1. **Access CloudWatch Logs**:
   - Go to the CloudWatch console.
   - View logs generated by Lambda functions.

2. **Set Up Alarms**:
   - Create CloudWatch Alarms to monitor Lambda performance and errors.
   - Configure notifications for critical issues.

## **Achievements**
- **Seamless Integration**: Combined frontend and AWS services for a scalable recommendation system.
- **Efficient Processing**: Utilized AWS Lambda and Bedrock for keyword generation and recommendation.
- **Scalable Hosting**: Deployed the frontend on S3 with optional CDN for enhanced performance.
